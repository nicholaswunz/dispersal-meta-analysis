## Abstract
Plastic pollutants are novel environmental stressors that are now persistent components of natural ecosystems. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols that leach out of plastics can modify physiological responses of animals by interfering with hormone signalling. Here, we tested whether three commonly produced bisphenols, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), impair thermal acclimation of swimming performance and metabolic enzyme [citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] activities in adult zebrafish (*Danio rerio*). We found that exposure to 30-μg l⁻¹ BPF and BPS, but not BPA, reduced swimming performance, and no interactions between bisphenol exposure and acclimation (3 weeks to 18°C and 28°C) or acute test (18°C and 28°C) temperatures were found. BPA interacted with acclimation and acute test temperatures to determine CS activity, an indicator of mitochondrial density and aerobic metabolic capacity. BPS reduced CS activity and an interaction (at a one-tailed significance) between acclimation temperature and BPF exposure determined CS activity. LDH activity reflects anaerobic ATP production capacity, and BPA and BPF altered the effects of thermal acclimation and acute test temperatures on LDH activity. Our data show that all bisphenols we tested at ecologically relevant concentrations can disrupt the thermal responses of fish. BPS and BPF are used as environmentally safer alternatives to BPA, but our data show that these bisphenols are also of concern, particularly in thermally variable environments.
