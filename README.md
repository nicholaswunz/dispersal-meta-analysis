## Abstract
Activity and exploration of novel environments determine local interactions, and larger scale dispersal can affect gene flow between populations. Physiology determines movement capacity and links animal movement to environmental variation. If physiology predicted movement, physiological traits could be used as indicators of the propensity for movement and dispersal in different environments. In two related meta-analyses, we aimed to establish the state-of-knowledge of the extent to which physiology mediates movement. Firstly, we determined whether physiological traits underlie individual movement, which we classified into activity within familiar environments, exploration of novel environments, and dispersal (88 studies).  Secondly, we determined whether physiological characteristics differed between individuals at the core of the distribution and those at the range edges (43 studies). Locomotor performance and metabolism affected individual movement, and differed between the range core and edge. Corticosterone levels and immunity were also greater at the range edge compared to the core. These physiological differences were particularly pronounced in birds and amphibians, and physiological differences between distributional core and edge increased with increasing time since separation. Additionally, there was a trend for dispersal to occur in the direction of warmer environments. Our analysis indicates that the range of different physiological traits and geographical areas are only sparsely represented in the literature. Future work should focus on broadening the physiological and geographical representation, particularly because the geographical areas worst affected by climate change are also the most undersampled. Physiological differences between the core and edge of distributions may reflect the cause or effect of dispersal, and it remains unresolved whether physiological differences are mediated genetically or reflect plasticity.
